# Linear-Regression-With-Tensorflow
A simple linear regression AI made with tensorflow. I made this to help teach myself the basics of AI, and did use a tutorial 
to make sure I was doing everything right

If you want to run this code, download Anaconda and use Spyder to run this, Anaconda comes with tensorflow pre-installed along with a bunch
of other useful libraries for python

Just a quick overview of what this code does:
this program generates a bunch of random points that have a preset "slope", and it is the AI's job to tell what that slope is.
In essence the AI is trying to find a line of best fit for the given data, and it does a pretty decent job of it (once the program has
trained, it will display a graph with the points and the AI generated line of best fit)
