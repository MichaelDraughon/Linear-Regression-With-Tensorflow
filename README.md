# Linear-Regression-With-Tensorflow
A simple linear regression AI made with tensorflow. I made this to help teach myself the basics of AI, and did use a tutorial 
to make sure I was doing everything right

If you want to run this code, download Anaconda and use Spyder to run this, Anaconda comes with tensorflow pre-installed along with a bunch
of other useful libraries for python
